## Design problem. 
First time programing something grafical

## Solution.
Just going through the process. Getting familliar with custom properties. This is easy to change colors later on.

Layering forms for example for the eye's
 background: radial-gradient(50% 50% at var(--x1) 47%, #fff 25%, #0000 0),
        radial-gradient(50% 50% at var(--x2) 65%, #fff 12%, #0000 0),
        radial-gradient(circle at 60% 50%, #000 40%, #0000 0), #fff;
     

## Design process and Tools.

This was a tutorial on Youtube. Practising my HTML and CSS

## Results.
My first image using only CSS. It was fun to create a design from nothing.

## What's Next.
I say that someone made a toggle light/dark mode with css. That would be a nice challenge. But I must practice this more to get the full understanding of all the options.

## What have I learned?

<ul>
    <li>Scale with font-size</li>
    <li>Article as canvas</li>
    <li>Custom properties (--*)</li>
